Based on my experience, I have created a comprehensive roadmap to master Machine Learning and Deep Learning, covering all essential mathematical aspects. It includes video lectures, reading materials, and hands-on tutorials. If you have no prior knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, or the underlying mathematics, this roadmap is perfect for you. Take your time to complete it, and by the end, you will be well-versed in these fields and ready to ace any machine learning interview. All you need is a basic understanding of Python programming.

### Roadmap:

1. **Machine Learning Specialization :** https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/

- The **Machine Learning Specialization** by `DeepLearning.ai` teaches you foundational algorithms and gives you hands-on experience in the world of machine learning. No prior mathematical knowledge is required, as the course guides you through the necessary concepts along the way.
