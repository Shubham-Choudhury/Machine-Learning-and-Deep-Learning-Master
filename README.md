Based on my experience, I have created a comprehensive roadmap to master Machine Learning and Deep Learning, covering all essential mathematical aspects. It includes video lectures, reading materials, and hands-on tutorials. If you have no prior knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, or the underlying mathematics, this roadmap is perfect for you. Take your time to complete it, and by the end, you will be well-versed in these fields and ready to ace any machine learning interview. All you need is a basic understanding of Python programming.

### Roadmap:

1. **Machine Learning Specialization <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/">[Link]</a> :** https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/

- The **Machine Learning Specialization** by `DeepLearning.ai` teaches you foundational algorithms and gives you hands-on experience in the world of machine learning. No prior mathematical knowledge is required, as the course guides you through the necessary concepts along the way.

2. **An Introduction to Statistical Learning <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/">[Link]</a> :** https://www.statlearning.com/

- **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** is one of the best books for learning machine learning. It covers a wide range of algorithms, including deep learning, and is highly recommended for anyone entering the field. You don't need prior mathematical knowledge to understand the material, as the authors explain concepts clearly. The book is available in two versions: one with implementations in `Python`, and the other in `R`. Be sure to read every page for a comprehensive understanding.
