Based on my experience, I have created a comprehensive roadmap to master Machine Learning and Deep Learning, covering all essential mathematical aspects. It includes video lectures, reading materials, and hands-on tutorials. If you have no prior knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, or the underlying mathematics, this roadmap is perfect for you. Take your time to complete it, and by the end, you will be well-versed in these fields and ready to ace any machine learning interview. All you need is a basic understanding of Python programming.

### Roadmap:

1. **Machine Learning Specialization <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/">[Link]</a> :** https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/

   The **Machine Learning Specialization** by `DeepLearning.ai` teaches you foundational algorithms and gives you hands-on experience in the world of machine learning. No prior mathematical knowledge is required, as the course guides you through the necessary concepts along the way.

2. **An Introduction to Statistical Learning <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/">[Link]</a> :** https://www.statlearning.com/

   **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** is one of the best books for learning machine learning. It covers a wide range of algorithms, including deep learning, and is highly recommended for anyone entering the field. You don't need prior mathematical knowledge to understand the material, as the authors explain concepts clearly. The book is available in two versions: one with implementations in `Python`, and the other in `R`. Be sure to read every page for a comprehensive understanding.

Now you understand what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, how they work, and how various algorithms function. However, we haven't yet explored the mathematical side of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Before diving deeper, let's first cover the essential mathematics required for these fields.

1. **Linear algebra <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">[Link]</a> :** https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra

   Machine learning models often work with matrices and vectors. Linear algebra is essential for understanding data transformations, operations on datasets (such as scaling, rotations), optimization algorithms, and many models like Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and neural networks.

2. **Differential Calculus <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus">[Link]</a> :** https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus

3. **Multivariable Calculus <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus">[Link]</a> :** https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus

   In machine learning, you need calculus to understand how to optimize a modelâ€™s parameters, particularly using gradient-based optimization algorithms like gradient descent. This is crucial for training models such as neural networks.
